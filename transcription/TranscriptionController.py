# The idea behind the code is to use https://refactoring.guru/fr/design-patterns/facade
# So the design pattern of Facade (in french yes) wan't to simplify the interaction
# with a set of class


# I named this class a controller cause the controller need to process the user input
class TranscriptionController:

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    # The main function that we need to call
    def startTranscription(self, input: str):
        pass
